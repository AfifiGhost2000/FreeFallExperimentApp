# FreeFallExperimentApp

FreeFallExperimentApp is a mobile application designed to facilitate free fall experiments by measuring and displaying the time it takes for a ball to fall from a certain height. The app provides a user-friendly interface to conduct experiments, record data, and calculate average fall times and acceleration.

## Features

- **User Authentication**: Secure registration and login system using Firebase.
- **Experiment Setup**: Easy setup of free fall experiments with real-time data collection.
- **Data Display**: Visual representation of experiment data using line charts.
- **Time Measurement**: Accurate measurement of fall time with multiple trials for reliability.
- **Data Averaging**: Calculation of average time for multiple trials.
- **Acceleration Calculation**: Computation of acceleration based on experiment data.
